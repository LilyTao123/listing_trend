# listing_trend
listing_trend analyzes sequences of numerical data to identify and describe trends such as increases, decreases, spikes, and drops.

The project uses linear regression and the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend test to evaluate trend direction and strength.

The Mann–Kendall method is robust to outliers and can reduce the impact of short-term spikes, making it effective for noisy data. However, for shorter data sequences, MK may be less sensitive, in which case linear regression provides better responsiveness and clarity.
